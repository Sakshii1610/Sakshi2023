#To automate the deployment of a virtual machine (VM) through another Ubuntu VM in a vSphere environment, you can use the vSphere CLI (Command-Line Interface) along with a scripting language like Bash or Python. Here's a Bash script that demonstrates how to deploy a VM using the govc CLI tool on an Ubuntu VM: VMau file 
#Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual vSphere configuration details, such as VCENTER_SERVER, VCENTER_USER, VCENTER_PASS, and other specifics related to your environment.

Before using the script, ensure that you have the govc tool installed on your Ubuntu VM, which is a CLI tool provided by VMware for managing vSphere environments. You may need to modify the script further to match your exact requirements, such as additional customization, network configurations, or post-deployment tasks.

Also, make sure that the VM template you specify (VM_TEMPLATE) exists in your vSphere environment and has the appropriate configuration.
